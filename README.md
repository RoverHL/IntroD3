D3 slides in D3 that [Vadim Ogievetskey](https://github.com/vogievetsky) put together after becoming frustrated with explaining D3 using PowerPoint.

The [v3 version](https://github.com/vogievetsky/IntroD3) was updated for D3 v4 by David Koop in February 2017. Selection immutability means that merges have been added when necessary. A few naming changes (e.g. d3.scaleLinear) have also been made. [d3-selection-multi](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi) is used to show how the object map version works in v4 for the sake of completeness, but there is a warning. There are no new examples.
